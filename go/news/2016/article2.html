                                    <p>Washington, D.C., October 28, 2015—Bloomberg BusinessWeek ranks the Howard University School of Business among the nation’s top full-time business school
                                    programs. The 2015 Bloomberg BusinessWeek business school survey ranks Howard University’s full-time Master of Business Administration program #50 among more than
                                    200 programs in the nation. Howard University is the only Historically Black College and University listed in the top 75 on the 2015 Bloomberg BusinessWeek
                                    ranking.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    For the 12th consecutive year, The Princeton Review has ranked the Howard University School of Business #1 in opportunities for minority students, in addition to
                                    placing Howard University in the top 5 for most competitive students.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    “This national recognition is reflective of the hard work and dedication of our faculty, staff, corporate partners, esteemed alumni and our exceptional MBA
                                    students,” said Dean Barron H. Harvey. “Howard University is very proud of this recognition and of being the first historically Black business school to be ranked
                                    in the top 50 MBA programs in the country.”<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The Bloomberg BusinessWeek ranking methodology includes an employer survey, alumni survey, student survey, job placement rate, and starting salary for program
                                    graduates. The highest marks for the Howard University School of Business are reflected in the alumni survey and job placement categories. This is the first year
                                    MBA students were surveyed after graduation to gain more insight into career expectations. Unlike previous rankings, calculations of faculty research were not
                                    included in the 2015 rankings. “For our program to be recognized again as one of the top MBA programs in the country, demonstrates that we are producing top level
                                    talent who are delivering results for their companies and communities, said Verna Supel, Director of the MBA Program at Howard University. “We are committed to
                                    ensure that our students are prepared to be global business leaders, as well as social servants, locally and worldwide,” added Supel.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    “The national recognition of our MBA program reflects the dedication, academic rigor, and commitment to excellence the University works to instill in all of our
                                    students,” said Dr. Wayne A. I. Frederick, president of Howard University and graduate of the Howard University Business School MBA Program. “Our students’ ability
                                    to apply their Howard education to address contemporary issues is further evidence that we are focused on curricula that is timely, relevant, and in demand,” added
                                    Frederick. The Howard University School of Business is the University’s second largest school among its 13 schools and colleges. With an outstanding reputation for
                                    excellence, the Howard University School of Business has consistently improved in academic achievement and program standards since its founding in 1970.</p>
