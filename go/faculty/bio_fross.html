                            <h3>Biography</h3>

                            Auditing and Ethics.In December, 2003, he retired from KPMG LLP after providing over thirty-eight years of service. Prior to retiring, he was the Mid-Atlantic Area

                            Chairman of the Board of the KPMG Foundation.</p>
                            <p>In 1968, Frank was one of the nine co-founders and the first President of the National Association of Black Accountants (NABA). Frank is a graduate of Long Island
                            University where he earned a Bachelors of Science degree in Accounting and an MBA degree. He received the Distinguished Alumni Award from Long Island University in 1998
                            and an Honorary Doctors of Humane Letters in 2001. He was the first graduate of their School of Business, Public Administration and Information Services to be so honored
                            by the University. In 2004, the University of the District of Columbia also awarded Frank an Honorary Doctors of Humane letters. In October 2008, Accounting Today named
                            Frank to its 2008 list of the 100 Most Influential People in Accounting. Also in October 2008, Diversity Edge named Frank to its 2008 list of 20 National Diversity

                            Accountant’s Success Story.” The book, which features a foreword written by former Time Warner Inc. Chairman and CEO Richard D. Parsons, is a classic and triumphant
                            American tale; a parable of how one man’s awe and inspiration at life’s possibilities was not thwarted or halted by the darker realities of racism, segregation and
                            discrimination. All proceeds from the sale of the book are earmarked for scholarships for accounting students.</p>

                            Chartered Middle School for Mathematics and Science (Treasurer).</p>
