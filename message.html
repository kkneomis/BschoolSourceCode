The 2014-2015 academic year will be remembered as a year of achievement. As we continue to provide a stellar business education for a wide range of students, this year a major focus was successfully navigating the reaccreditation process. This again builds upon our proud legacy as the first business school in the nation’s capital to become AACSB-International accredited, which we first achieved in 1976. Accreditation also provides a stamp of approval, if you will, that our coursework and curricula meets or exceeds globally accepted standards for business education. On March 28th, the School of Business’ accreditation status was reaffirmed for another five years by the Board of AACSB-International.<br><br>

We are able to consistently excel because of the unwavering support of our alumni, sponsors, parents and partners. As we approach our 45th Anniversary in 2015 as a stand-alone, full-service business school, we are able to keep our systems updated and provide aid to student because of your contributions of time and financial resources. The School will soon welcome you to participate in our upcoming building campaign which will fund a future state-of-the-art brick-and-mortar headquarters for classes, conferences, case competitions and lectures.<br><br>

Of course, not resting on past accomplishments, the Howard University School of Business, continues to embrace new opportunities and collaborations. So, what’s new?<br><br></p>
              <ul>
                <li>We welcomed three new faculty members this year. The infusion of new academic minds always invigorates the learning environment.</li>
                 <li>We welcomed a new director of development, Kevin Hendricks. He brings a solid, successful background of building corporate relationships.</li>
                 <li>Five of our senior faculty members received tenureâ€”a lauded career accomplishment that speaks to their commitment to academic rigor.</li>
                 <li>Three new senior executives joined our Board of Advisors. Fostering and maintaining good relationships with leaders in various industries keeps the Howard University School of Business top of mind when executives are hiring, offering internships and leadership programs and looking to provide mentorship.</li>
                <li>Our 18th annual two-day conference, the MBA Exclusive, featured keynote speaker and alumnus Frank Savage, acclaimed investment executive and chairman emeritus of the Howard University Board of Trustees. In the fall, the 19th Annual MBA Exclusive will welcome Carla Harris, Vice Chair of Global Wealth at Morgan Stanley.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>As always, we hosted several top officials for our very popular Executive Leadership Series, which included top-level speakers from AIG, Bank of America, Boeing, DeLoitte, Eli Lilly, Ingersoll Rand, Morgan Stanley, Northern Trust, SAP, and Verizon, as well as members of the U.S. Congress and ambassadors to the U.S. One notable visitor, Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s popular chief operating officer, launched her ˵Lean In˶ program for women while here. We also launched a partnership with SAP, its first collaboration with a university.<br><br>

Many of our guests shared with students and faculty the importance of global citizenship, a point that is underscored by the many opportunities our students have to study and provide business consulting services abroad as part of their coursework. Within the United States, we have teams traveling and winning competitions, as well as students participating in exchange programs in five countries. These experiences allow students to interact with business leaders as they gain cultural competency skills needed to navigate in the international economy. Last May, 42 students and six faculty members traveled to India; this fall, 30 students traveled to China; and at the end of this academic year, another 30 students will travel to Brazil.<br><br>

Our formula continues to produce a well-prepared leader as our statistics show. For example, our School of Business Executive Leadership Honors Program boasts 100 percent placement for all graduates! This year’s incoming class is also an example of the Howard University School of Business brand of excellence as they represent the best averages of incoming grades and test scores in the School’s history.<br><br>

The accomplishments of this closing academic year serve as the foundation for coming years of success and growth.</p>
