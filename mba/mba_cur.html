                                <p>A cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.00 (or Standard Letter Grade of “B”) is required for graduation. Students in the MBA program that earn a grade of “C” or
                                less in more than two courses will be dropped from the MBA program. When a student’s GPA falls below 3.0, s/he must raise the GPA to 3.0 during the subsequent semester
                                in which the student is enrolled. Students failing to do so will be dropped from the MBA program.</p>
                                <h3>RESIDENCE REQUIREMENTS</h3>

                                completed the MBA within the time limit will be dropped from the MBA program. If that student wishes to complete the MBA, s/he would need to reapply and be readmitted
